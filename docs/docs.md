# stio_studio Documentation

This docs are more documented about what does those different functions in the stio_studio library for doing math or other stuff. It also will be more detailed about classes and variable options and all other stuff.

A lot of the stuff that you'll find in stio_studio are mostly coming as inspiration from other languages like JS, to do so that new users will be having a better understanding of the language. The language also has no limitations, so you can joke around and create functions, and you can do stuff that basically not all languages offer.

## Variables 

Here in stio, you can create variables almost anyway you want. 

```stio
// You can create a basic variable:

let x = 5
