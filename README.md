### Options on variable:
number/num, string/text, boolean, function/func/def, object/obj, class, int/floot, 


### How to make a variable.
```
The thing that defines the variable. Can be var, let, int, float, function,  
 |      Options. This is optional. It can be anything in the "option on variable"  
 |      |           The name of the variable  
 |      |           |        Can be =, +=, -=, *=, /=,  
 |      |           |        |      The value of the variable  
 |      |           |        |      |  
var {string} I_am_a_variable = "hello world"
```

### Some functions:
```js
for(){
    //your code
}
//just like the normal for loop

repeat(times){
    //your code
}

while(boolan){
    //your code
}

forever{
    //your code
}

object console = {
    show(boolean),
    hide(boolean),
    log(message),
    error(message),
    warn(message),
    warning(message),
}


```
